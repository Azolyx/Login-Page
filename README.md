# Login-Page

## Description

This is a simple login page coded in html and php. It uses cookies to save logins and will autologin you if you logged in before. It also includes a feature that I wish was used in many websites of automaticly logging you in when you register in the register page.

## Notes

- This uses PDO for connecting to the database.  
- It was tested using a MYSQL database so it might not work with others.
